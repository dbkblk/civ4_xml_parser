# Civ. IV - Asian executable patcher

## Usage
Civilization IV only support ISO8859-1 out of the box. A japanese version was edited with a different executable. Now pseudo-UTF8 support is out for the mod, Asian languages support (Japanese, Chinese and Korean) have been added using the japanese executable and some symlinking to trick windows and the game. This executable does this automatically. It is automatically asked to launch when a player choose one of these languages in the launcher.

## Requirements
Nothing

## Execution
Just execute it in the checker/ subfolder.
